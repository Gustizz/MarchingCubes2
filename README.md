# **Procedural Terrain Generation with Marching Cubes and Compute Shaders**

---

## **Introduction**
This project is a procedural terrain generator that utilizes the marching cubes algorithm to create dynamic and detailed 3D terrain. The core of this system is implemented using compute shaders, which allows for highly parallel and efficient computation on the GPU, significantly speeding up the terrain generation process.
