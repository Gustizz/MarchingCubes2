# Procedural Terrain Generation with Marching Cubes and Compute Shaders

---

## **Introduction**

This project is a procedural terrain generator that utilizes the **marching cubes** algorithm to create dynamic and detailed 3D terrain. The core of this system is implemented using **compute shaders**, which allows for highly parallel and efficient computation on the GPU, significantly speeding up the terrain generation process.

## **Examples**

Here are some examples of the generated terrain, showcasing the variety achievable with the procedural generation system.
